1) LEFT JOIN 
The LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left 
table and the matched records from the right table.

 select * from dept d left join emp   
   e on d.deptno=e.deptno;

2) RIGHT JOIN 
The RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right 
table and the matched records from the left table.
If there is no match, NULL values will be returned
select * from emp e right join dept   
   d on d.deptno=e.deptno;

3) full outer JOIN
Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN , 
so we use a combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN
 with UNION.

select * from dept d left join emp   
   e on d.deptno=e.deptno 
   UNION
   select * from dept d right join emp   
   e on d.deptno=e.deptno;

 4) CROSS JOIN (Cartesian Join)
The CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product
 of the two tables.
Every row from the first table is combined 
with every row from the second table.
If table1 has m rows and table2 has n rows,
 the result set will have m * n rows.

  select * from emp cross join dept;

5)self join
A SELF JOIN is when a table is joined with itself.
Table aliases are necessary  
It can be an INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, or RIGHT JOIN.
