clauses 
it allows us to sort, group , condition 
and limit the data

1) where clauses - select ,delete and update
it is used to specify a condition
select * from emp where job='manager';
delete from emp where emno=2398;
update emp set ename='john' where empno=8277;

2) distinct 
it is used to display the unique set of values
select distinct(deptno) from emp;
select distinct(job) from emp;

3) order by
it is used to sort the columns in asscending and 
descending order

asscending order
select * from emp order by deptno;
select * from emp order by sal;
descending order
select * from emp order by deptno desc;

4) limit
it is used to specify the no of records to return

select * from emp limit 5;

highest salary in a emp table
select * from emp order by sal desc limit 1 ;

5) offset
it is used to skip the records
2nd highest salary
select * from emp order by sal desc limit 1 offset 1;

3rd highest salary
select * from emp order by sal desc limit 1 offset 2;

select * from emp order by sal desc limit 10 ;
select * from emp order by sal desc limit 10 offset 10;
select * from emp order by sal desc limit 10 offset 20;

shorthand                                 offse, limi
select * from emp order by sal desc limit 20, 10  ;

6) group by
it is used to group the similar values as a group
it is mostly used with aggregating functions

count the no of emp in each job role
 select job,count(job) from emp group by job;

max salaries in each department no
select deptno,max(sal) from emp group by deptno;
7) having

functions 
1) single row functions
each row will return one output
7 rows ---7 outputs

2) multi row function - aggregate functions
it will take multiple rows as a inputs and 
returns single value
7 rows- 1 output

min sal
select min(sal) from emp;

max
select max(sal) from emp;

sum
select sum(sal) from emp;

avg
select avg(sal) from emp;

count
select count(ename) from emp;
select count(*) from emp;
select count(comm) from emp;-4,it will ignore null

note 
we cannot mention non aggregating column with aggregating function
aggregate funcs will ignore values
